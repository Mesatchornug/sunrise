LED panel

The plan is to create an illuminated panel about the size of a picture frame with various pre-programmed lighting effects. It will have an ultra-simplified control mechanism to start, likely either a few keys, a knob, or some combination of the two.

I expect the actual technical backbone to be a length of APA-102 LED strip and a Teensy microcontroller

When complete, I hope to scale it to a series of interconnected crown moulding. the biggest challenge there sounds like the power draw.
